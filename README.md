# MiAM_eurobot2019
## Electronics and code of MiAM's robot for Eurobot 2019.

This repo contains code and electronics design files related the 2019 Eurobot competition of MiAM,
a French team of former students from MINES ParisTech and Arts et MÃ©tiers schools.

For older files related to the 2018 robot setup, see [MiAM_eurobot2018](https://github.com/matthieuvigne/MiAM_eurobot2018) repo.
The 2019 repo started from the 2018, but has adapted to the new robot architecture (motors, sensors...)

See [MiAM website](https://www.miam-robotique.fr/) (in French).
